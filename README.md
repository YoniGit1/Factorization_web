# Factorization_web

Application to decompose a number.
Each number can be written as a product of two or more prime numbers.
These numbers are called the "factors" of the number,
and the decomposition of the number is called "factorization"
The factorization will be presented in two ways :
Exponential 
and tree of the factors of the number.
